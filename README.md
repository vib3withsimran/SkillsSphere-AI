## ⚡ Quick Start (Unified Setup)

To simplify setup, you can now run the entire project using root-level scripts.

### Install all dependencies

```bash
npm run install-all
```

This installs:

- Root dependencies
- Client dependencies
- Server dependencies
- Python microservice dependencies (creates `interview-ai-service/venv` and downloads spaCy model)

### Run everything (client + server + Python microservice) from root

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- Frontend (client)
- Backend (server)
- Interview AI Service (Python microservice on port 8000)

### One command (first-time or fresh clone)

```bash
npm run quickstart
```

### Optional: run only client + server (no Python service)

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

> ⚠️ Backend requires environment variables to run properly. Refer to the Environment Setup section below.

## Scalable Folder Structure

The following structure keeps the project modular and easy to scale for new contributors:

## For Open-Source Contributors

If you want to contribute, start by understanding:

1. Which user group your change helps (student, tutor, recruiter)
2. Which module it belongs to (classrooms, resumes, matching, interviews, dashboard)
3. Whether the change impacts frontend, backend, AI/ML, or multiple layers

This approach keeps contributions focused, reviewable, and scalable.

## Contributor Resources

- Contribution Guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Code of Conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Security Policy: `SECURITY.md`
- PR Template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Issue Templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Detailed Structure Notes: `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- PR Quality Gates: `docs/QUALITY_GATES.md`

## PR Checks and Code Review Safety

Automated checks run on pull requests to `main` through:

- `.github/workflows/pr-quality-checks.yml`

These checks validate docs/workflows and, once app code is added, automatically run lint/test/build for `client`, `server`, and `ai-ml` when their dependency manifests exist.

## 🚀 Running the Project (Manual Setup)

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Interview AI Service (Python microservice)

This service powers speech-to-text transcription and answer evaluation for the Mock Interview module. The Node backend can run without it (it falls back to mock scores), but for real AI evaluation you should start it locally.

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
cd interview-ai-service

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate
# Linux/Mac:
# source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download spaCy English model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run the API (default port 8000)
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`

Optional env var (defaults to `base`): `WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=tiny|base|small|medium|large-v3`

## 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

> ⚠️ The backend will not start without configuring the required environment variables.

### Server

1. Copy example file:

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update required values in `server/.env`:

- `MONGO_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Required for AI Cover Letter Generation)

```env
# AI/ML Configuration (Required for semantic matching — free tier)
HF_API_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token

# Email Setup (if using console/smtp directly in server)
EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=console
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="SkillsSphere AI" <your-email@gmail.com>

# Evaluator toggles and weights (optional)
EVALUATOR_SKILL_MATCH_ENABLED=true
EVALUATOR_KEYWORD_MATCH_ENABLED=true
EVALUATOR_EXPERIENCE_MATCH_ENABLED=true
EVALUATOR_SKILL_MATCH_WEIGHT=1
EVALUATOR_KEYWORD_MATCH_WEIGHT=0.2
EVALUATOR_EXPERIENCE_MATCH_WEIGHT=0.2

# Interview AI Service (Python microservice for answer evaluation)
INTERVIEW_AI_URL=http://localhost:8000
INTERVIEW_AI_TIMEOUT=10000
INTERVIEW_AI_TRANSCRIBE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### Client

1. Copy example file:

```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env
```

2. For local development, keep:

- `MONGO_URI` or `MONGODB_URI`
- `PORT` (backend default: `5000`)
- `JWT_SECRET` (required for JWT registration)
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (optional, default is `7d`)
- `HF_API_TOKEN` (free — required for semantic resume-to-job-description matching, get at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>)
- `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Google OAuth Setup

- `JWT_SECRET=skillsphere_dev_jwt_secret_1234567890abcdef`
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d`
- `EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=console` (Use "smtp" for real emails)
- `EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io`
- `EMAIL_PORT=2525`
- `EMAIL_USER=your_smtp_username`
- `EMAIL_PASS=your_smtp_password`
- `HF_API_TOKEN=hf_...` (Free — required for semantic resume matching)

1. Open Google Cloud Console.
2. Create/select your project.
3. Configure OAuth consent screen.
4. Go to Credentials and create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application).
5. Add Authorized redirect URI exactly as:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback
```

6. Copy Client ID and Client Secret into `server/.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5174
```

7. Restart both backend and frontend after updating env files.

OAuth flow summary:

- Frontend starts OAuth from `/api/auth/google`.
- Google redirects to backend callback (`GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`).
- Backend creates JWT and redirects to frontend callback (`FRONTEND_URL/auth/callback`).

## 📧 Email SMTP Setup (Gmail)

To use real email notifications (OTP verification, password reset) via Gmail, follow these steps:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification**: Go to your [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and ensure 2-Step Verification is ON.
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Search for "App Passwords" in your Google Account search bar.
   - Enter a name (e.g., "SkillsSphere AI").
   - Click **Create**.
   - Copy the **16-character code** (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`).
3. **Update `server/.env`**:

   ```env
   EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=smtp
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
   EMAIL_FROM="SkillsSphere AI" <your-email@gmail.com>
   ```

4. **Restart the server** to apply changes.

### 📝 Testing Email Verification (Console Mode)

For local development and testing without configuring an SMTP provider:
1. Set `EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=console` in `server/.env`.
2. When registering a user, the server will output the 6-digit OTP directly to your terminal console instead of sending an email.
3. Retrieve this OTP from the server command line logs and enter it in the frontend verification modal to complete the registration flow.
